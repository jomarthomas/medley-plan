# medley-plan


Concise, actionable documentation to prepare for the 2026 Distance Medley sequence: 5K → 10K → Half Marathon.

Purpose
- Provide a lean weekly training template, race sequencing logic, and a lightweight tracking + review system for steady progress toward the three races.

How to use this repo (weekly)
- Follow the `docs/weekly-template.md` pattern each week and log sessions in `docs/tracking.md`.
- Update the weekly log every Sunday evening and set the weekly fatigue flag (Green/Yellow/Red).
- Make minor adjustments weekly (±10% volume or swap sessions). Use the monthly review for larger changes.


How to upload health exports
- Place raw device exports and screenshots into the matching `/health-data/` subfolder. Use the required naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_device_metric.ext` (examples and accepted file types are in `/health-data/README.md`).
- Do not transform or summarize raw exports inside the archive — keep originals for audit.

Device ecosystem
- Apple Watch Ultra (resting HR, HRV, sleep)
- Polar H10 (preferred chest strap for VO2 and tempo sessions)
- KardiaMobile 6L (EKG strips)
- OMRON Evolv (blood pressure)
- Smart Fitness Scale (body composition)


Medley overview
- Sequence: 5K (speed/VO2 focus) → 10K (threshold/sustainable speed) → Half (endurance + fueling).

Weekly training template (summary)
- Mon: long run (aerobic endurance)
- Tue: VO2 intervals (quality intensity)
- Wed: rest or active recovery
- Thu: tempo (threshold work)
- Fri: easy + short strength
- Sat: full-body strength
- Sun: speed endurance (short reps or race-pace reps)

Update cadence
- Weekly: 10-minute quick review and log updates; record fatigue flag and any session notes.
- Monthly: 30-minute structured review; save a monthly snapshot (see `PLANS.md`) and document changelog entries.

Privacy reminder
- This repository must be private. It stores sensitive, personal health exports and screenshots. Do not publish, share, or sync publicly.
- Files here are raw data only. This repo does not provide medical advice or automated interpretation.
