# Boston Half Marathon Training Plan

## Weekly Pattern

This 12-week plan follows a structured approach optimized for half marathon preparation:
- **Monday** — Rest/recovery day
- **Tuesday** — Easy to moderate mileage, with intervals added in main phase
- **Wednesday** — Rest/recovery day
- **Thursday** — Quality day with intervals or tempo work in main phase
- **Friday** — Rest/recovery day
- **Saturday** — Easy to moderate mileage or race simulations
- **Sunday** — Long run: progressive distance with rolling hills or steady effort

## Guidelines for progressions
- Increase volume no more than 10% per week across total mileage.
- Prioritize either intensity or volume in any one week — avoid stacking big increases in both.
- Progress interval difficulty by adding reps or reducing recovery before increasing pace.

## HR zones and device guidance
- Use chest strap (`Polar H10`) for VO2 and tempo sessions to capture high-fidelity HR and time-in-zone. Wrist-based monitors (Apple Watch Ultra) are acceptable for steady aerobic work, resting HR, HRV and sleep.

## Shoe guidance

- Use the `New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Trainer v3` for long runs and steady aerobic/quality aerobic days.
- Use the `New Balance Fresh Foam X More v5` for easy runs, recovery days, and post-interval shakeouts.
- Reserve the `New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Elite v4` for race day and limited race simulations only.

## Rules
- `Elite v4` — never used for routine workouts; limit simulations to no more than 1–2 controlled sessions during Peak.
- Rotate `Trainer v3` and `More v5` across easy and steady days to distribute mechanical load and control fatigue.
- Manually track cumulative shoe mileage in the `docs/tracking.md` shoe rotation log; retire shoes when cumulative miles reach your chosen threshold.
