Shoe rotation log

| Date | Session Type | Shoe Used | Distance | Notes on Feel | Cumulative Mileage |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---:|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Long / Easy / VO2 / Tempo | SuperComp Trainer v3 / Fresh Foam X More v5 / SuperComp Elite v4 | 0.0 | brief note | 0 |

Shoe roles (short)
- `New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Trainer v3` — Long runs and steady quality aerobic days.
- `New Balance Fresh Foam X More v5` — Easy / recovery mileage.
- `New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Elite v4` — Race day and limited race simulations only.

Rotation rules
- Do not use the Elite v4 for routine interval sets or high-volume weeks; reserve for race efforts and a few controlled simulations.
- Rotate Trainer v3 and More v5 on consecutive easy/steady days to reduce repetitive stress and preserve the Elite v4 for races.


How to use
- Fill weekly row by Sunday. Keep `Key sessions` concise (session shorthand).
- `RPE` is session-averaged; `HR notes` capture unusual spikes or low variability.

Simple fatigue flag system
- Green: progressing; sleep adequate; soreness manageable.
- Yellow: elevated soreness or RPE; reduce next week's volume/intensity by ~10–20%.
- Red: persistent high RPE, poor sleep, or pain — stop hard sessions and assess.

Recording conventions
