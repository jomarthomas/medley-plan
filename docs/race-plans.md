# Race Plans

This file contains concise execution guidance for each distance: pacing principles, warmup checklist, and half-marathon fueling guidance.

5K execution plan
- Training plan: See [Boston 5K Training Plan](boston-5k-training.md) for an 8-week structured training program.
- Focus: controlled aggression — fast from the gun, maintain tempo-like tolerance for the middle, finish maximal.
- Pacing principles: start controlled to avoid early lactate spike; settle into planned target effort by km 1 and hold or negative-split.
- Warmup checklist: 10–15 min easy jog, 3–4 strides, 2 short accelerations, mobility and dynamic drills.

10K execution plan
- Focus: sustainable high-intensity — maintain threshold to slightly-above-threshold for middle 60–70% of race.
- Pacing principles: conservative opening kilometer, target evenly-paced kilometers or small negative splits, avoid large surges until last 2 km.
- Warmup checklist: 15–20 min easy, strides, 2×2 min at race pace with 2 min easy recovery, mobility.

Half marathon execution plan
- Focus: consistent tempo and fueling; plan to run controlled first half and increase effort if legs permit.
- Pacing principles: start slightly conservative (~5–10% easier than target effort), take measured surges only after fueling and at checkpoints.
- Warmup checklist: 10–15 min easy, dynamic mobility, 2–3 strides; keep warm pre-race but avoid excessive fatigue.
- Fueling guidance: test fueling in long runs. Typical plan: 30–60g carbs per hour after first 45–60 minutes; use easily tolerated intake (gels, chews, drink). Practice bottle/grab strategy on long runs.
