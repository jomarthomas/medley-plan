# Boston 5K Training Plan

This training plan is designed for the BAA Boston 5K race, following an 8-week progression to optimize 5K performance.

## Weekly Pattern

Structured pattern for 5K-specific training:
- Monday — Long run: steady aerobic effort; target progression by distance or time each week (40-60 minutes).
- Tuesday — VO2 intervals: short intervals (e.g., 6–8 × 400–800m) at high intensity with full recoveries. Use the Polar H10 chest strap for session HR capture where possible (preferred for accuracy during high-intensity efforts).
- Wednesday — Rest: full rest or very light active recovery (mobility, easy 20–30 min).
- Thursday — Tempo: sustained threshold work (e.g., 2 × 20 min at threshold with short recovery). Chest strap preferred for tempo sessions (Polar H10) to verify time-in-zone.
- Friday — Easy + strength: easy run 20–40 min + 20–30 min targeted strength/hypertrophy.
- Saturday — Full-body strength: 40–60 min session emphasizing posterior chain and core; keep intensity controlled.
- Sunday — Speed endurance: shorter reps/race-pace work (e.g., 8 × 200m or progressive 5K reps), focus on turnover and neuromuscular quality.

## Guidelines for Progressions

- Increase volume no more than 10% per week across total mileage.
- Prioritize either intensity or volume in any one week — avoid stacking big increases in both.
- Progress interval difficulty by adding reps or reducing recovery before increasing pace.
- For 5K-specific training, prioritize VO2 max and speed endurance sessions as race day approaches.
- Schedule a deload every 4th week or when fatigue flags escalate: reduce volume 30–50% and keep quality sessions shorter and fewer. Prioritize sleep and low-intensity aerobic movement.

## HR Zones and Device Guidance

- Use chest strap (`Polar H10`) for VO2 and tempo sessions to capture high-fidelity HR and time-in-zone. Wrist-based monitors (Apple Watch Ultra) are acceptable for steady aerobic work, resting HR, HRV and sleep.
- For 5K training, HR zones are critical during VO2 max intervals (Zone 5, 90-100% max HR) and tempo runs (Zone 4, 80-90% max HR).
- Monitor recovery HR between intervals to ensure adequate rest before the next repetition.

## Shoe Guidance

- Use the `New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Trainer v3` for long runs and steady aerobic/quality aerobic days.
- Use the `New Balance Fresh Foam X More v5` for easy runs, recovery days, and post-interval shakeouts.
- Reserve the `New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Elite v4` for race day and limited race simulations only.

## Rules

- `Elite v4` — never used for routine workouts; limit simulations to no more than 1–2 controlled sessions during Peak (weeks 6-7).
- Rotate `Trainer v3` and `More v5` across easy and steady days to distribute mechanical load and control fatigue.
- Manually track cumulative shoe mileage in the `docs/tracking.md` shoe rotation log; retire shoes when cumulative miles reach your chosen threshold.
- For 5K-specific workouts (VO2 max intervals, speed endurance), the `Trainer v3` provides optimal energy return while protecting legs.
