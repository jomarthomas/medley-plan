# Compound Strength Block (Pull / Legs / Push)

Purpose
- Lean, compound-only strength protocol to support B.A.A. Distance Medley 2026 preparation. Designed for AM strength sessions integrated with evening running (VO2 / Tempo / Endurance).

Program rules (global)
- Sessions: Tuesday AM — Pull; Wednesday AM — Legs; Thursday AM — Push.
- Exercises per session: 3–4 compound movements.
- Sets: 3–5 sets per exercise. Reps: 3–6 for main lifts; accessory compound 6–8 if needed.
- RPE cap: 7–8 (never to failure). No grinding reps.
- Session time: 35–45 minutes. Rest 2–3 minutes for main lifts.
- No isolation, no hypertrophy blocks, no plyometrics, no circuits.
- Deload every 4th week: reduce volume ~40% and keep RPE ≤6.

Integration rules with running
- If evening VO2 or tempo feels compromised: reduce lower-body volume by 1 set or 20–30% that day.
- If weekly fatigue flag is Yellow: reduce total strength volume by ~20% and keep RPE ≤7.
- If fatigue flag is Red or HRV is markedly low for 3 consecutive days: skip heavy strength; perform maintenance mobility and light activation only.
- Never exceed RPE 8. Avoid sets to failure.

Tuesday — Pull (Upper posterior chain)
- Goal: upper-back strength, posture, arm-drive efficiency. Keep CNS load moderate for evening VO2.
- 1) Trap-bar or Barbell Deadlift (moderate intensity): 3–4 sets × 3–5 reps, RPE 7–8, 2–3 min rest.
- 2) Weighted Pull-ups or Lat Pulldown: 3–4 sets × 4–6 reps, RPE 7.
- 3) Barbell or Single-arm Dumbbell Row: 3 sets × 5–6 reps, RPE 7.
- 4) Optional — Farmer Carry (short heavy carries) 3 × 30–60s for grip and stability (low CNS impact).

Wednesday — Legs (Primary strength day)
- Goal: build lower-body strength while protecting evening recovery.
- 1) Back Squat or Front Squat: 3–5 sets × 3–5 reps, RPE 7–8, 2–3 min rest. If evening run is high intensity, reduce sets by 1.
- 2) Romanian Deadlift: 3–4 sets × 4–6 reps, RPE 7.
- 3) Bulgarian Split Squat (weighted): 3 sets × 6 reps per leg, RPE 7.
- 4) Optional — Calf Raise (bodyweight or light load) 2–3 sets × 8–10 reps (low priority).

Thursday — Push (Upper anterior chain)
- Goal: shoulder and chest strength, upper-body stability for efficient arm drive.
- 1) Bench Press or Dumbbell Bench: 3–5 sets × 3–6 reps, RPE 7–8.
- 2) Overhead Press (barbell or dumbbell): 3–4 sets × 3–6 reps, RPE 7.
- 3) Weighted Dips or Close-Grip Bench (horizontal press variant): 3 sets × 5–6 reps, RPE 7.
- 4) Optional — Push-up variation (low fatigue) 2 × 8–10 reps for movement quality.

Deload (every 4th week)
- Reduce volume ~40%: drop one set per exercise and shorten main lifts to 2–3 sets.
- Cap RPE ≤6. Focus on technique, movement quality, and recovery.

Session decision matrix (quick)
- Evening run = VO2 high-intensity → reduce leg session volume by 20–30% or drop 1 set on squats.
- HRV low or sleep poor → reduce load by 10% and/or reduce sets by 1 across the session.
- Any new localized pain → pause heavy lift and consult clinician; replace with low-load stability.

Tracking template

| Date | Session | Lift | Weight | Sets | Reps | RPE | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | ---- | ------:| ----:| ----:| ---:| ----- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Tue/Wed/Thu AM | e.g., Back Squat | 0 lb/kg | 3 | 5 | 7 | brief note |

Implementation notes
- Keep the program conservative in volume to avoid DOMS that would impair evening sessions.
- Prioritize barbell and dumbbell compounds. Avoid accessory isolation work.
- Strength sessions are supportive — not primary — to running adaptation. Adjust load based on weekly training stress and device-derived recovery signals (HRV, sleep).
