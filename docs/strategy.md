# Strategy

Medley sequencing logic
- Order rationale: 5K first preserves top-end speed and allows a phase focused on VO2 work; 10K follows with extended threshold emphasis; Half concludes the sequence focusing on sustained pacing and fueling.
- Training emphasis shifts: power/speed → threshold endurance → aerobic durability and fueling.

Periodization summary
- Base: build aerobic foundation, easy consistency, introduce light strength.
- Build: increase intensity and threshold volume; longer tempo runs and progressive long runs.
- Peak: highest quality, reduce volume slightly while preserving intensity; include race simulations.
- Taper: reduce volume 20–40% while retaining sharp, short intensity; prioritize recovery.

Fatigue management principles
- Monitor acute:chronic load using weekly mileage and RPE trends.
- Use the fatigue flag (green/yellow/red) each week; when yellow, reduce intensity or volume by ~10–20%; when red, prioritize recovery and medical assessment.
- Prefer conservative reductions (one session removed or shortened) rather than repeated high-load weeks.

How to adjust if training load is too high
- Immediate steps: one active-recovery week (reduce volume 30–50%, keep light intensity), reassess sleep and nutrition.
- Mid-term: reduce peak long run by 10–20% for next 2–3 weeks; remove one hard session per week.
- If symptoms persist >2 weeks: consult a clinician and shift to maintenance volume until cleared.
