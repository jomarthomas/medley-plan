# Reviews

Weekly review (10 minutes)
- Time: 10 minutes each Sunday or Monday.
- Sections:
  - Quick metrics: total miles, key session outcomes, fatigue flag.
  - What improved: 1–2 bullet points.
  - What regressed: 1–2 bullet points.
  - Immediate change: one concrete tweak for next week (volume/intensity/replace session).

Monthly review (30 minutes)
- Time: 30 minutes at month end.
- Sections:
  - Snapshot: paste last 4 weekly rows from `docs/tracking.md`.
  - Checkpoint status: fitness tests, long-run targets, tempo progression.
  - Analysis: trends in RPE, sleep, HR; note injuries or availability changes.
  - Plan update: adjust next month's macros (volume, priority sessions, recovery weeks).
  - Tagging: Save a short changelog entry and create a monthly snapshot tag as described in `PLANS.md`.

Short injury prevention checklist
- Warm up before intervals and hard tempo work.
- Address niggles early: reduce intensity for one week if localized pain appears.
- Maintain regular strength (posterior chain) and mobility.

Health Signal Review (monthly)

- Purpose: compile raw device exports and summarize signal trends for manual review. Do not interpret diagnostically.
- Metrics to record each month and data source:
  - Resting HR trend (Apple Watch Ultra)
  - HRV trend (Apple Watch Ultra)
  - HR zone accuracy / session verification (Polar H10 chest strap for VO2 and tempo sessions)
  - Blood pressure average (OMRON Evolv)
  - Body composition trend (Smart Fitness Scale)
  - EKG recordings summary (KardiaMobile 6L)
  - Sleep duration trend (Apple Watch Ultra)
- Process: reference the raw files stored in `/health-data/` (use date-based filenames) and note short observations (1–2 lines). Link the specific files by filename; no automated analysis and no medical conclusions.
