# Roadmap & Versioning

Purpose
- High-level quarterly milestones and checkpoints that guide weekly execution toward the 5K → 10K → Half sequence.

Quarterly milestones (leading to 2026 races)
- Q1 (Base): build consistent aerobic base, establish routine, mileage stability, two benchmark fitness tests.
- Q2 (Build): raise intensity and threshold volume; introduce race-specific sessions; target long runs to 75% of half distance.
- Q3 (Peak/Sharpen): finalize race-specific work (VO2 for 5K, threshold for 10K, long runs + pacing for Half); simulate race efforts.
- Q4 (Taper/Execute): short, high-quality sessions, reduce volume, race execution and recovery.

Checkpoints
- Fitness tests: 5K time trial or 20-minute TT (quarterly), 3km VO2-style test (as needed).
- Long-run targets: progress long run to 12–16 miles for half training phase; intermediate checkpoints at 8, 10, 12 miles.
- Tempo progression: 2 → 3 → 4 × 10–20 min at threshold across build weeks.

VO2 & body-composition checkpoints
- VO2 progression: begin with shorter VO2 sessions (e.g., 6×400–800m) in Base, increase volume/intensity across Build to longer VO2 reps or additional sets; validate with a short VO2-style test each quarter.
- Body composition checkpoints: record scale exports monthly; target realistic, small changes (if any) and use body-composition results as context for fueling and recovery decisions.

Adjustment rules
- Small weekly changes: alter volume by ±10% or swap sessions as needed based on fatigue flag.
- When a yellow fatigue flag appears: reduce next week's volume or intensity by ~10–20% and monitor sleep/HR.
- When red: halt hard sessions, prioritize recovery, and defer major plan changes until a 7–14 day reassessment.

Monthly snapshot tagging
- Create a simple monthly tag like `v2026-03` when completing the monthly review. Add a one-line changelog entry here with the tag date and summary.


Weekly vs Monthly updates
- Weekly: session notes, adjustments to pace/volume, one-line fatigue flag, mileage totals.
- Monthly: structured review with changes to macro plan, snapshot tag, and formal goal check (use `docs/reviews.md`).

Versioning approach
- Monthly snapshot tags: use a simple, readable tag like `v2026-03` to mark monthly plan state.
- Keep single-source of truth in these files; append short changelog entries at the end of `PLANS.md` when snapshots are made.

What gets updated
- Weekly: log entries and micro adjustments (volume ±10%, swap recovery days if needed).
- Monthly: checkpoint status (pass/fail), update milestones, and note any injury/availability constraints.
